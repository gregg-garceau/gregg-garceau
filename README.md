# Hi thereðŸ‘‹

## Hi! I'm Gregg, a software engineer with a passion for challenging myself, and building intuitive web applications!
## I love coding because building something that might help that lives of someone, no matter how big or small motivates me everyday. I was a Pre-Med major before I pursued coding, which is the reason why I always love to help others. Coding is a lot like being a doctor in ways. You see a problem and figure out the best way to handle it. I gain great satisfaction from working with others on projects and being part of a team that can build and develop something awesome.

# Hi thereðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Gregg, a Software Engineer with a passion for challenging myself, and building intuitive web applications!

I love coding because building something that might help that lives of someone, no matter how big or small motivates me everyday. I was a Pre-Med major before I pursued coding, which is the reason why I always love to help others. Coding is a lot like being a doctor in ways also. You see a problem and figure out the best way to handle it. I strive everyday to make myself a better engineer than the last, and always look into new technologies and ways of going about my coding.
